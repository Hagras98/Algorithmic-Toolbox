#Problem Introduction#
#You are organizing a funny competition for children. As a prize fund you have 𝑛 candies. You would like to use these candies for top 𝑘 places in a competition with a natural restriction that a higher place gets a larger number of candies. To make as many children happy as possible, you are going to find the largest value of 𝑘 for which it is possible.

#Problem Description#
#Task: The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer 𝑛 as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be written as 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + · · · + 𝑎𝑘 where 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑘 are positive integers and 𝑎𝑖 ̸= 𝑎𝑗 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑗 ≤ 𝑘.
#Input Format: The input consists of a single integer 𝑛.
#Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 109.
#Output Format: In the first line, output the maximum number 𝑘 such that 𝑛 can be represented as a sum of 𝑘 pairwise distinct positive integers. In the second line, output 𝑘 pairwise distinct positive integers that sum up to 𝑛 (if there are many such representations, output any of them).
